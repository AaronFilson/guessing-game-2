# Guessing Game October 2nd, 2015.
In lab assignment for B34 for using GH and writing some code

Driver: Aaron
Navigator: Nkiru

Added images and arrays.
Added CSS styling to the project.

In this project we learned about delays, bits and bytes, and how to load images into a DOM with JS. Nkiru learned a lot of hex, and interaction of files. Fun!

And many commands and shortcuts!
